## Homebrew for the mos tool

Homebrew is the missing package manager for OSX. You can find installation
instructions at http://brew.sh.

## Adding mos Homebrew tap

`mos` is not part of the Homebrew core, so you need to add a tap to install
it. Open your terminal and enter:

```
brew tap cesanta/mos
```

## Installing mos

As easy as:

```
brew install mos
```

This will install the most recent release.

## Updates

In order to update software to the latest version use:

```
brew update && brew upgrade mos
```
